=============================
The Multiplication Principle
=============================

The Multiplication Principle (MP) is a foundational counting principle that helps
us determine the number of outcomes of a multi-stage counting process. Generally,
the idea is that a counting process can be broken into multiple stages, and, if
certain conditions are met, then the number of outcomes of the total process is
the product of the number of outcomes at each stage.

As with the Addition and Subtraction principles, this is, on its face, a fairly
intuitive idea. However, when we formalize it, there are some important ideas
to consider. We prefer Tucker's (2002) statement of the MP, provided below.
In this worksheet, we will talk through the reasons for components of Tucker's
statement and provide practice with the MP.


Multiplication Principle (MP)
-------------------------------

  Suppose a procedure can be broken into m successive (ordered) stages, with :math:`r_1`
  different outcomes in the first stage, :math:`r_2` different outcomes in the second stage, ..., and
  :math:`r_m` different outcomes in the mth stage. If the number of outcomes at each stage is independent
  of the choices in previous stages and if the composite outcomes are all distinct, then
  the total procedure has :math:`r_1 \times r_2 \times ... \times r_m` different composite outcomes.

This may sound abstract, and our goal is to present and discuss a sequence of problems
that make the Multiplication Principle (MP) more clear. Consider first a problem about
creating outfits from your wardrobe.

Problem 1: Outfits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You have four different tops (a tee, a sweater, a tank, and a blouse) and three different bottoms
  (shorts, capris, and jeans). How many different outfits are you able to make?

To solve this problem, we can think about picking an outfit to wear in two stages.
First, we specify a top to wear (there are four to choose from), and then we specify
a bottom to wear (there are three to choose from). You'll notice that we aren't
restricting which tops and bottoms may go together, so we say that the choice of
bottom is independent of the choice of top. Thus, for any of the four tops, we have
three bottoms we can choose.

Further, anytime we choose a top and a bottom, we will get a unique outfit. While this
may seem obvious now, it's important to emphasize and will be relevant when we solve
more challenging problems.

The reason for pointing out that our counting process can occur in two stages, that
the number of choices in each stage is independent, and that the resulting (composite)
outcomes are all distinct is so that we know we are in the exact situation that
the MP describes. Now that we have done so, we know that there are :math:`4\times 3 = 12`
outcomes.

To visualize these outcomes, consider the table below where we list every outcome:

+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
|              |        **Shorts**   |        **Capris**      |     **Jeans**       |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| **Tee**      | (Tee, Shorts)       |   (Tee, Capris)        |   (Tee, Jeans)      |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| **Sweater**  | (Sweater, Shorts)   | (Sweater, Capris)      | (Sweater, Jeans)    |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| **Tank**     | (Tank, Shorts)      | (Tank, Capris)         | (Tank, Jeans)       |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| **Blouse**   | (Blouse, Shorts)    |  (Blouse, Capris)      | (Blouse, Jeans)     |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+


This table neatly organizes the outcomes by using rows to distinguish between the tops,
and columns to distinguish between the bottoms. You may notice that in any row
all the tops are the same, and in any column all the bottoms are the same. We could have
created this table one row at a time, where for every option of top we cycled through
every option of bottom. Let's carry out this counting process using computer code.

Examine the code below. After you run it, compare the result to the table above and relate
the result to the mathematical expression :math:`4\times 3` .

  Suppose now you had 4 different tops, 5 different bottoms, and 3 different pairs

  reasoning.

Cartesian Product Problems
---------------------------------

The two outfits problems you have solved are examples of Cartesian Product Problems.
We are starting with two sets - a set :math:`T` which denotes all Tops and a set
:math:`B` which denotes all Bottoms. From these sets, we can create a new set, which
consists of all pairs of Tops and Bottoms, exactly as we did for the first problem.
We call this new set the Cartesian product of :math:`T` and :math:`B`, and we use the
symbols :math:`T\times B` to denote this set.

More formally, if you start with any two sets, say sets :math:`X` and :math:`Y`,
the Cartesian product of :math:`X` and :math:`Y` is the set of all pairs :math:`(x,y)`
where :math:`x` comes from :math:`X` and :math:`y` comes from :math:`Y`. We use the symbols
:math:`X\times Y` to denote the Cartesian product of sets :math:`X` and :math:`Y`. We can also
take the Cartesian product of more than two sets, and the resulting Cartesian product is
all the ways to take an element from each set and pair them together. We have seen this as well, like
when we found all outfits that consisted of a top, a bottom, and a pair of shoes. If :math:`T` is the
set of tops, :math:`B` is the set of bottoms, and :math:`S` is the set of shoes, then
the set :math:`T\times B\times S` is all the possible combinations of a top, a bottom, and a
pair of shoes.

In the realm of counting problems, we say a problem is a Cartesian Product Problem
if the set of outcomes of that problem can be encoded as a Cartesian product. As we have described,
both of the outfits problems you've solved are Cartesian Product Problems. A nice
similarity among all Cartesian Product Problems is that they can be solved using
the multiplication principle. If you can represent the outcomes of a counting problem
as a Cartesian product of sets, then the total number of outcomes is the product
of the size of each set. For example, when we counted the total number of outfits
we could make from a set of tops (:math:`T` with size :math:`|T|`) a set of bottoms (:math:`B`
with size :math:`|B|`) and a set of shoes (:math:`S` with size :math:`|S|`), we found
that the total number of outfits was :math:`|T|\times |B| \times |S|` (the total
number of tops times the total number of bottoms times the total number of pairs of shoes).

Let's solve another Cartesian Product problem.

Problem 3: Coin, Dice, Letter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  How many ways are there to first flip a fair coin, then roll a 6-sided die, and
  then pick a letter from the alphabet?

.. shortanswer:: shortmult2

  First things first, explain why the Coin, Dice, Letter problem is a Cartesian
  Product problem. Then, describe how you will find the total number of outcomes.

The code below generates the outcomes of the Coin, Dice, Letter problem. We will
represent the ways to flip a coin as 'H' and 'T', the ways to roll a 6-sided dice
as the numbers 1 through 6, and the ways to choose a letter from the alphabet as
the numbers 1 through 26. Predict the first five outcomes of the code before you
run it.

    As you scroll through the output of the above code, you may notice that the outcomes
    are split into two groups--those that start with "T" and those that start with "H".
    How many outcomes are there that start with "T"? (Use the analysis tool to answer this question!)

    Hint: this problem is very similar to, but not exactly, a Cartesian Product problem.

Cartesian Products with copies of the same set
-------------------------------------------------

So far, we have only looked at Cartesian Product Problems where each set of objects
was distinct (for example, the set of Tops was distinct from the set of Bottoms).
However, there are counting problems that make use of Cartesian products of the
same set multiple times. Consider the following problem.

Problem 4: Coin Flip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  How many ways are there to flip a coin 4 times in a row?

If we think of the outcomes of flipping a coin once as either `H` or `T`, then
we can think about the outcome of flipping a coin four times as a string of four
letters, where any letter is either an `H` or a `T`. For example, the outcome
`HHTH` can represent flipping a head on the first, second, and fourth toss, and flipping
a tail on the third toss. If we let the set of flipping a coin once be :math:`F=\{H,T\}`,
then the outcomes of flipping a coin four times in a row  can be represented as
:math:`F\times F\times F\times F`. Like before, the total number of outcomes
of these problems is still the product of the size of each set. In the case of flipping
a coin four times, there are :math:`2\times 2\times 2\times 2 = 16` outcomes.

We should talk about the independence of choices at each stage and the uniqueness
of composite outcomes. We'll use coin flips as an example. By saying that the
choices at each stage are independent, we mean that no matter the previous coin flip
the possible ways to flip the next coin are exactly the same. For example, if your
first coin was flipped heads, then the second coin could still be heads or tails. When
we say uniqueness of composite outcomes, we mean that each four letter combination
of Hs and Ts represent a different outcome. For example, compare outcomes HHTH and
HTHH. Even though each of these outcomes had three heads and one tails, the outcomes are unique
because the tails were in different coin flips; in the first outcome, the tail occurred
on the third coin flip whereas in the second outcome the tail occurred on the
second coin flip. Because the orders of the Hs and Ts matter in the outcomes, then
the composite outcomes are unique.

Problem 5: Quiz Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  On a quiz, there are 6 True/False questions. How many ways can a student
  finish the quiz, if they put an answer for every question?

  For the above question, fill in the code below and use the analysistool to count the number of outcomes.

Here is another problem that will set us up well for more discussions about the MP.

Problem 6: 3-Digit Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  How many 3-digit sequences can we make using the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f}, if
  we can repeat letters in our sequence?

For the 3-Digit Sequences problem, write some code that prints the possible outcomes.

Check your work by answering the following multiple choice problem and using the analysistool:

    :answer_c: 6*6*6 = 216
    :feedback_a: Incorrect.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect.
    :feedback_c: Correct. Well done!

    How many 3-digit sequences can we make using the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f}, if
    we can repeat letters in our sequence?

Why Independence Matters
---------------------------

While we have discussed that the number of choices at each stage of the counting
process is independent of each other in problems like the Outfits problem or the Head
Tails problem, we have not given any examples of when the number of choices aren't independent.
We will give a cautionary example of a problem where the number of choices is not independent.
With this in mind, one of the best ways to determine if the number of choices
at each stage is independent is to focus on how you might write down each
outcome, taking note if there are ways to reduce the number of options at later stages
by selecting specific options in earlier stages.

Consider the following problem:

Problem 7: Face Card, Heart Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  How many ways are there to make a two-card hand, where the first card is a face
  card and the second card is a heart? You may assume that the order of the cards
  matters, but you must have two distinct cards (e.g. you cannot have two Jacks of Hearts).

On the face of it (pun intended), this problem seems like a Cartesian Product problem.
After all, there are are 12 face cards (3 per suit) and 13 hearts, so why isn't the
answer :math:`12\times 13`? The problem is that the number of ways to pick a heart is
not independent of the number of ways to pick a face card. For example, if we picked the
king of spades as our face card, then there are 13 possible ways to pick a heart
card; however, if we picked the king of **hearts** as our face card, then there
are only 12 ways to pick a different heart card. Hence, this problem is not a Cartesian
Product Problem.

That is not to say that we cannot use the MP in our solution of the problem, only that
the solution is not :math:`12\times 13`. For this problem, we can break our solutions into
two cases: in the first case, our face card is not a heart card, and in the second case our
face card is a heart card. (Notice here that we are leveraging the Addition Principle!)
In the first case, the number of choices at each stage is independent, because choosing
a non-heart face card does not limit the number of heart cards to draw. Hence, there are 9
non-heart face cards, and for each of these there are 13 possible heart cards to draw. So,
there are :math:`9\times 13 = 117` ways to fulfill our first case. In the second case,
although each choice of a heart face-card limits the options for the second card (e.g.
if our face card is the king of hearts, then the remaining cards to draw are the ace
through queen of hearts), the **number of options** for drawing the second card remains
the same. For any choice of heart face-card, there are 12 options for the second card.
Hence, we can apply the MP to find that there are :math:`3\times 12 = 36` ways to
fulfill our second case. Because the two cases are distinct and the two cases demonstrate
all ways to select a face card and a heart, then there are :math:`9\times 13 + 3\times
12 = 153` ways to select a face card and a heart card.

The code below gives this, with a cell for each part. Use the analysistool to count the outcomes and verify it is correct.

Applying the MP to other types of problems
--------------------------------------------

While Cartesian Product Problems are excellent examples of problems that can
be solved using the MP, there are other types of problems that can be solved using
the MP. This really comes down to a key distinction in how the MP is worded. Specifically,
we can apply the MP when the **number of choices at each stage** is independent. This is not
exactly the same as saying the **choices at each stage** is independent. The exact choices at
each stage are allowed to change, as long as the number of choices does not. We will
work through a few problems where the exact choices change at each stage, although
the number of choices remains the same.

Consider the following problem:

Problem 8: Small lottery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You have placed slips of paper with the numbers 1 through 5 in a bag,
  with one sheet of paper per number. You are going to draw out three slips of
  paper, one at a time, without replacing the slips of paper each time. How many ways
  are there to draw three slips of paper from the bag, one at a time without replacement,
  in order to create a sequence of three numbers?

We can think about a counting process for this problem as occurring in three three stages:
choosing the first slip, choosing the second slip, and choosing the third slip. Let's discuss
each stage. For the first stage, there are 5 ways of choosing a slip because there are
5 slips of paper in the hat. However, the options for the second stage depend on what you
drew in the first stage. For example, if you chose number 1 in the first stage, then
the options for the second stage are the numbers 2 through 5. However, no matter the
choice in the first stage, you have only removed one of the slips of paper so there
must be four choice in the second stage. We can therefore apply the MP because the number
of choices at the second stage is always four, even if the exact choices may be different. Similarly,
for any choice in the first and second stage, you have only removed two of the slips, so there
are three choices for the third stage. Therefore, there are :math:`5\times 4\times 3` ways
to draw the slips of paper from the hat.

Here is one way to list all such outcomes:

Problem 9: How to appoint roles among your friends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Suppose that you are hanging out with your friends Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Drax,
  and Peter. From those five friends, you want to appoint a Captain and a President.
  How many ways are there to do this?

Let's consider the case where you choose Rocket as your Captain. In this case, the people
you can choose for President are Groot, Gamora, Drax, and Peter. However, if you choose Drax
as your best friend, then the people you can choose as President are Groot, Gamora, Rocket,
and Peter. Clearly, the people you can pick for President depend on who you choose to
be your Captain. However, the number of people for President is independent of who you choose to be
your Captain: for every possible Captain, there are four possible people you can
choose for President. Thus, we can still apply the MP to solve this problem, finding that there are
:math:`5\times 4 = 20` ways to choose a best friend and a person to ostracize.

The code below solves provides this problem. Note that the "minus item1" ensures that we
will not pick the same person as President who is already Captain.
