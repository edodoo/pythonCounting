Type 1 - Arrangement with Repetition
=========================================



In this section, we present some tasks involving arrangement with repetition
problems. In our 2x2 grid, this is the cell in which unrestricted repetition
is allowed, and we are counting ordered outcomes (or arrangements). In problems
like these, we can employ multi-stage processes, where we have the same number
of options at each stage because repetition is allowed.

For instance, consider the following problem: ::

  1. "How many length 5 binary strings are there?"

Here, we have five positions, and we can employ a five-stage process where we
consider the number of options at each position. Since there are 2 options
(0 or 1) at each position no matter the choice of any previous position, we
use the multiplication principle to yield :math:`2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^5 = 32` total
outcomes.

Below is some code that generates all of the outcomes. Notice the nature of the
outcomes themselves - repetition is allowed (something like 0 0 0 0 0 is a valid
outcome), and we are counting ordered outcomes (outcomes like 1 0 0 0 0 and 0 0 0 0 1 are
listed as distinct outcomes).

   :answer_c: 8 outcomes start with 01
   :feedback_a: Incorrect.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect.
   :feedback_c: Correct. 8 outcomes start with 01, as there are 8 possible outcomes for the remaining three positions once 0 and 1 are in the first positions.

   How many outcomes start with 01?

   :feedback_b: Correct. 10110 is the 23rd outcome in the list.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. 11111 is the 32nd outcome in the list.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. 10111 is the 24th outcome in the list.

   Following the process that the code represents, what is the 23rd outcome
   in the list?


Let's look at a couple more examples. ::

  2. There are 12 people competing for three different prizes. The same person
  can win multiple prizes, but ties are not allowed. How many possible outcomes are
  there for how the 3 prizes can be distributed to the 12 people?

Note we can think of a three-stage process, where we give out a first,
second, and third prize. For each stage, any of the 12 people can win, no
matter who was picked previously. Thus, there are 12 choices for each of the
three prizes, so our answer is :math:`12 \cdot 12 \cdot 12 = 12^3 = 1728`.

Solve the Parson's problem below to create code that produces all the outcomes for
this problem.

                print(i,j,k)
                counter += 1
    =====

Now answer the following questions about this code.

Quick Check 2.1
----------------

.. mchoice:: QC1_3
   :correct: b
   :answer_a: Person A and Person G do not receive prizes
   :answer_b: Person A receives the first prize and the third prize, and Person G receives the second prize
   :answer_c: Person A receives the first prize, and Person G receives the second and third prizes
   :feedback_a: Incorrect.
   :feedback_b: Correct. The each term in the output shows who received each respective prize. Because people can receive multiple prizes, here A won two prizes (first and third) and G won the second prize.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect.

General formula for Arrangements with Repetition
-------------------------------------------------

We now discuss a general formula for these kinds of problems.

Notice that there is a commonality among the mathematical expressions that
solve this particular kind of problem. In general, if we have :math:`n` distinct
objects, and we are arranging :math:`r` of them, where repetition is allowed, there
are :math:`n^r` total outcomes.

To see why this works, note that if we are arranging :math:`r` elements, we can
think of :math:`r` stages in our counting process, and at each stage we consider how
many options there are at that stage. Since repetition is allowed, we have :math:`n`
options at each stage. These are independent choices at each stage, and using
the multiplication principle, we multiply :math:`n` together :math:`r` times, giving
us :math:`n^r`.

In terms of coding problems like this, notice that we can have :math:`n` elements in
our initial list, and we can have :math:`r` nested for loops cycling through these elements without restriction. These
correspond to the :math:`r` stages in our counting process, where at each stage we
are cycling through all :math:`n` options in our list. ::

                           print(i,j,k,l,m,n)
                           print(counter)
   =====

Coordinating multiple applications of this formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As is often the case, most problems will not be only a direct application of
this formula, :math:`n^r`, but rather they will involve or incorporate it in some
way into a broader problem. Here we offer some examples of how this formula
might arise or be used in problems. ::

  7. How many different license plates involving three letters and three digits
  are there if the three letters appear together, either at the beginning or the end of the license plate?

Notice here that there are two cases, each of which involves our formula. In
both cases we are considering 26 options for each letter and 10 options for
each digit; the multiplication principle applies in each case.

In one case, the three letters are at the beginning of the license plate. Then
there are :math:`26 \cdot 26 \cdot 26 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10` or :math:`26^3 \cdot 10^3 = 17,576,000` total
license plates.

In the other case, the three letters are at the end of the license plate. Then
there are :math:`10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 26 \cdot 26 \cdot 26` or :math:`10^3 \cdot 26^3 = 17,576,000` total
license plates.

These are distinct cases, so we can add the total together, so our total number
of license plates is :math:`26^3 \cdot 10^3 + 10^3 \cdot 26^3 = 35,152,000`.

Now let's try another problem. ::

  8. At my bank, a PIN consists of 4 digits (from 0 to 4). How many PINs
  are there with no consecutive digits?

Note, here, we can apply our formula. We can think of a 4-stage process, where
in each stage we consider the number of options for each respective digit
(first, second, third, and fourth). In the first stage we can choose any number,
so there are 5 options. In the second stage, we can choose any number except
what was chosen first, so there are 4 options. In the third stage, we can choose
any number except what was chosen directly previously, so again there are 4
options. In the fourth stage, again we have 4 options.

So, our final answer is :math:`5 \cdot 4^3 = 320`.

Run the code and examine the output.
