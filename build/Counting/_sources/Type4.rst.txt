Type 4 - Selection With Repetition
======================================

In this section, we present some tasks involving selection with repetition problems.
In our 2x2 grid, this is the cell in which repetition is allowed, and we are
counting unordered outcomes. Essentially, we are counting multi-sets, or sets in which
multiple elements are allowed. In problems like these, we can again employ multi-stage
processes, where elements can be repeated. For instance, we can count something like
111, 112, 233, etc. However, in addition, we must consider duplicate outcomes, as
we do not want to count ordered outcomes, but rather unordered outcomes. For instance,
in counting ordered outcomes, we might count 112, 121, and 211 as distinct outcomes.
In counting unordered outcomes, we do not consider those as distinct; they are all the
same multi-set {1, 1, 2}. Like we did with type 3 problems (selection without repetition),
we can reframe unordered as uniquely ordered.

A typical problem of this type involves selecting some set of objects from different
types of objects, as that suggests that objects can be repeated. For example, consider
the following problem: ::

  There are six different types of hotdogs (regular (R), chili (C), footlong
  (F), deluxe (D), spicy (S), and bratwurst(B)), and you are buying three
  hotdogs to share with your two friends. How many possibilities are there for
  which kinds of hotdogs you select, if it is undecided who will get which dog?

Because it is undecided who will get each dog, the order that you pick the hot dogs
doesn't matter.
Let us think of what kinds of outcomes we could have. You could buy three regular,
which would suggest an outcome like RRR, or chili (CCC), or you could buy two
footlongs and one deluxe (FFD). Notably, you are only counting how many
possible outcomes there are - you don't care who gets which hot dog, so there is no
distinction between two footlong hot dogs, say (so, FFD and FDF are the same outcome).
In this way, we can see that the outcomes are multisets - sets of hot dogs where
repetition is allowed. The outcomes can be encoded as three-letter sequences from the
letters R, C, F, D, S, B, where repetition is allowed. The question now is, how many
such outcomes are there? We will answer this in this section.

We can be clever in how we represent our hot dogs. If we consider the six
different kinds of hot dogs as being represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,
then let us consider what different outcomes might be. Now the outcomes can be
thought of as non-decreasing sequences of length 3. A non-decreasing differs from
an increasing sequence because a non-decreasing sequence can repeat numbers; for
example, 1 1 2 is non-decreasing because it does not decrease, but it is not strictly increasing
because a number is repeated. Indeed, an equivalent way to frame
this question is to ask the following: ::

  How many non-decreasing sequences of length three are there from the
  numbers 1 through 6?‚Äù

Here are the outcomes. We've listed them so that each row corresponds to all
outcomes starting with a particular number. ::

  111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666,
  112, 223, 334, 445, 556,
  113, 224, 335, 446, 566,
  114, 225, 336, 455,
  115, 226, 344, 456,
  116, 233, 345, 466,
  122, 234, 346,
  123, 235, 355,
  124, 236, 356,
  125, 244, 366,
  126, 245,
  133, 246,
  134, 255,
  135, 256,
  136, 266,
  144,
  145,
  146,
  155,
  156,
  166

To be explicit about representing hot dogs in this way, note that for any choice
of three hot dogs, it can correspond to a three-digit nondecreasing sequence. We
could make the correspondence of R - 1, C - 2, F - 3, D - 4, S - 5, and B - 6. So
an outcome like 255 would mean you bought a chili dog and two spicy dogs. We make
this connection because we will write a program that counts non-decreasing sequences,
and any such selection with repetition problem can be similarly encoded as
non-decreasing sequences.

In particular, the following code is written to list out all possible nondecreasing
sequences of the numbers 1 through 6. Run this code. Do you get what you expect?

Quick Check 2
=================
 Which part of the code helps us ensure that the sequences we are counting are nondecreasing?

Finding a General Solution
----------------------------

It is difficult to find a general solution for these types of problems if we only encode our outcomes
as multisets (e.g. {R, R, C}) or as non-decreasing sequences (e.g. 1 1 2). Let's
introduce our final way to encode these outcomes, which is commonly referred to
as stars and bars. Suppose we were ordering hotdogs, and we were given a piece
of paper with each of the types of hotdogs on it. If we put tally marks under each
type of dog to indicate the number of that type we wanted, we could represent our order
something like this:


.. image:: /Images/T4.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center

This order would indicate that we want two regular and one chili dog.
When written exactly like this, there is quite a bit of information that is not relevant
to counting. For example, the names of the types of hot dogs does not matter. If we
know the order of the types of hot dogs in the top row, we really only need the bottom row, like so.

.. image:: /Images/T4Encoded.png
    :align: center

So, we have stripped a lot of the unnecessary information away by representing
our selection of hot dogs as an arrangement of three + signs and five bars.
For the sake of writing on a keyboard, let's change symbols. We will replace the :math:`|` with
a B, for bar, and we will replace the :math:`+` with an s, for star. So, the
way to write :math:`++|+||||` will be ssBsBBBB.


.. fillintheblank:: Type4_starbar_interpret
   :casei:

   The way to represent two footlongs and a Bratwurst using the symbols
   s and B is |blank| .

   -   :BBssBBBs: Correct.
       :x: Incorrect. The answer is BBsBBBs.

Let's focus on determining the number of bars. There are six types of hot dogs,
and by using five Bs we can create the six columns needed for the hot dogs.
In general, you will need one fewer
B than columns (or category). Since we are choosing three hotdogs, we are placing
three s's among those five Bs. In general, you will need the same number of s's
as the number of items being selected.

So, our outcomes now look like arrangements of five Bs and three s's. Further,
any such arrangement will produce a unique outcome, and we can represent every outcome
like this. This tells us that the number of ways to choose three hot dogs from six
types of hot dogs is the same number of ways to arrange three s's and five
Bs. This gives us eight objects total.
Whenever we arrange three s's and five Bs, we can think about putting
these objects into eight positions, and wherever we place the three s's we
know the five Bs must fill in the remaining positions. Thus, there are
:math:`{8\choose 3}` ways to arrange the s's and Bs. This tells us that there
are :math:`{8\choose 3}=56` ways to pick three hot dogs from six types of hot dogs.


.. mchoice:: Type_4_MC2_1
   :correct: d
   :answer_a: 11 - 3
   :answer_b: 4 + 4
   :answer_c: 5 + 3
   :answer_d: (6 - 1) + 3
   :feedback_a: Incorrect.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect.
   :feedback_c: Close, but d better represents the 8.
   :feedback_d: Correct

   The 8 in :math:`{8\choose 3}` is best described by which expression?

This method of representing outcomes as arrangements of s's and Bs works best
to create a general formula because we already know how to count them. Consider
the general problem:

  Suppose there are :math:`n` distinct types of objects, and you are selecting
  :math:`k` objects (where you can select any number from each type). If the order
  of the objects being selected does not matter, how many ways are there to
  do this?

We can think about how to represent our objects as s's and Bs. To do so, we
must figure out how many s's and how many Bs we are arranging.
The Bs are used to create columns, where you need one fewer B than you need
columns. If we have :math:`n` types of objects, we can represent a column for each
type using :math:`n-1` Bs. The s's are used to represent how many of each type
we are selecting. We need the same number of s's as the number of objects
we are selecting. So, if we are selecting :math:`k` objects, then we need
:math:`k` s's. Our final outcomes will be arrangements of :math:`n-1` Bs
and :math:`k` s's. So, there are :math:`n+k-1` total objects which means we are
placing :math:`n-1` Bs and :math:`k` s's into :math:`n+k-1` positions. There
are :math:`{n+k-1\choose k}` ways to choose the positions of the s's, and the
rest of the positions will be filled in by the Bs. This gives us our general
solution:

  Suppose there are :math:`n` distinct types of objects, and you are selecting
  :math:`k` objects (where you can select any number from each type). There are
  :math:`{n+k-1\choose k}` ways to do this.
